OVERVIEW
1. Give each player a rating 40-100
2. Each rating is converted to 0-60
3. Those ratings are elongated to 0-100
4. Those ratings are used as probabilities each attribute is good
	a. Rating for a guy is 94 - very good chance that he is has good contact



Thoughts
1. How to allow good hitters who are bad at other attributes
2. Pitching?
3. What are the distributions in need?
	a. ie should 80% of people be on the slower end and the 20% have an exceptionally higher speed?
4. Use python classes?
