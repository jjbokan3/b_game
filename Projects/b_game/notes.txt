OVERVIEW
1. Give each player a rating 40-100
2. Each rating is converted to 0-60
3. Those ratings are elongated to 0-100
4. Those ratings are used as probabilities each attribute is good
	a. Rating for a guy is 94 - very good chance that he is has good contact
5. Randomly choose (or through weights) the order of attributes that get picked
    a. e.g. Speed/stealing -> contact -> fielding -> power
6. After each one, the players value goes down for the remaining attributes
7. Weights on each attribute will differ
    a. power being more important than speed
8. Choosing whether hitters are l/r and whether they hit better against same side


Thoughts
1. How to allow good hitters who are bad at other attributes
2. Pitching?
3. What are the distributions in need?
	a. ie should 80% of people be on the slower end and the 20% have an exceptionally higher speed?
4. Use python classes?
5. Re-rate players based on their new attributes?
6. Different ways to play?
    - Primarily passive play
    - Involved in more decisions
    - Complete managerial game

NOTES

Leagues
- 6/8 leagues
- Each includes progressively better teams
    - This avoids dynamically changing players on AI teams
    - Each league is (like most elements) based on a normal distribution of ratings of players
- Once you win the world series in the top league, you can opt to play against dynamically generated teams at the same level; you play that same group of teams until you win it again; you gain a badge for each of those wins


Structure
- players are Player objects who have all attributes associated with them
- teams are Team objects that are composed of players and methods in association with other teams
- leagues are leagure objects that are composed of a collection of teams
- highest level is the save file for the game (as you can have multiple on each machine)


Playing
- Two ways: simple vs complex
- Complex
    - Each game is ran like any normal game
    - At-bats
        - Harder hit balls (player with more power) more likely to get throw on a ground ball,




Game Overview
1. League of teams (same format as mlb)
2. You pick the name of your team (or randomly assign)
3. You open packs of players that fill your initial roster
4. Computer generated teams are given similar players
5. Tiers (leauges) of computer generated squads
